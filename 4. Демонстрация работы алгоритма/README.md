I wanted to like this movie based on the earlier ones and took my kids... was I wrong, it was 
awful. The whole movie is based on the red car trying to get his mojo back because he's too old 
or needs work, and in the end he basically quits. And still gets called the "winner." I don't 
like to overly analyze movies or entertainment and will watch and enjoy things with any 
reasonable message about self-empowerment, until that entertainment tries to shove a ridiculous 
message at people --- defeatist. More or less inane level propaganda, and about how NOT to 
succeed at something at that. If you want to see a real comeback movie, and one that makes a 
little sense, just rent any Rocky. 1 through 7 (or whatever they are on....) There are tons of
 other good ones.

Just saw this film at an early family showing before the actual release, and I have to say, it was
 a great companion to the original! By that, I mean, you see from Lightning McQueen's perspective
 exactly how Hudson felt in the original film.
Seeing how Lightning makes his way in a group of rookies is very reminiscent of himself against 
the King and Chick Hicks in the original. Ligtning seems to be humbled in this new entry. However,
 Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks voice is surely missed. Even my seven year old son asked!
Glad to see the flashbacks, but sometimes overused. A great movie experience for the whole family.
